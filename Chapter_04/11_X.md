----------

### Adding fields to ***app-account/***```models.py```
- New tables ```Contact```
    1. ```user_from```, ```user_to``` and one more ```following``` :D
    2. migrate it 
        - ```./manage.py makemigrations account```
        - ```./manage.py migrate```

### and views & routes (both under the app-account folder)
- ***views.py***
    - preparation
        - create some users () 
            - & upload respective avatars, do it at admin-page!
        - It seems that the *avatar* part is missing in the registration page...
    - notes 
        - We’re only adding two funcs: ```user_list``` (all users) & ```user_detail``` (one’s detail)
- ***urls.py***
    - add these 
        - ```path('users/', views.user_list, name='user_list'),```
        - ```path('user/<username>/', views.user_detail, name='user_detail'),```
    - then **get the absolute url**! 
        - This time we alter the **settings.py** (under proj-bookmark folder)
        - add the ```ABSOLUTE_URL_OVERRIDES = ...``` (go see the code for details)
### two more templates under ***app-account/templates/account/***
- first create a folder called ```user```
    - **list.html** 
    - **detail.html**
### finally 
- add an entry to the homepage! 
- right here: ```app-account/templates/```**```base.html```**
