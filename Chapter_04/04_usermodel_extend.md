### Foreword 
- We're gonna talk about ***extending the user model*** :P
- It's gonna be FUN!! ðŸ¤£

### Preparing stuff
- base model ```account/models.py```
    - a new class called ```Profile```
        1. a user
        2. birth date 
        3. photo (aka *avatar*)
- static stuff (**avatar** needed)
    - ```settings.py```
        - ```MEDIA_URL = '/media/'```
        - ```MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media/')```
    - ```proj-bookmarks/urls.py```
        - sth like ```urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, ...)```
    - and a new module 
        - ```pip3 install Pillow=5.1.0```
- migrate it, please :P
    1. ``` ./manage.py makemigrations``` 
    2. ```./manage.py migrate```
- one more step, *registering* it inside the ```app-account/admin.py``` 
    - Just a glimpse: ```... ProfileAdmin ...``` (go see the code!)
- **Now** you should be able to see it at [localhost:8000/admin/account/profile/](http://localhost:8000/admin/account/profile/)
    - Also the avatars you uploaded will stored at the root folder (same level as proj | app)
    - of course it's bad practices, we'll just place it there for now, might fixing it later :P
    
### Edit profile 
- add two more *forms* (actually ***display as solely one***) (```app-account/forms.py```)
    - ```UserEditForm``` (stuff of built-in)
    - ```ProfileEditForm``` (stuff of our-own)
- ```app-account/views.py```
    - simply **validate** & **make-changes-to-DB**
- ```app-account/urls.py```
    - dead-simple route: ```edit/```
- finally! our templates 
    1. the core one that displaying the *forms* (```templates/account/edit.html```)
    2. and add a link to our (sort-of) homepage (```templates/account/dashboard.html```)
