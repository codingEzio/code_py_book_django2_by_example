### Note 
- The todo-list (of Chapter 06) is stored at the 11st notes 😀
- Be sure to un-check the items when we've finished one of them :)

----------


### Foreword
- *Denormalizing* counts <=> optimize read performance 
- Some preparations ⌨️
    1. add a new field (```total_likes```) to ```app-images/```**```models.py```**
    2. migrate 
        - ```./manage.py makemigrations images```
        - ```./manage.py migrate images```

### New concept: ***signals***
- Purpose 
    - *Signals are very useful when u need ur code to do sth every time sth happens*.
- There're **some** signals for models (located at ```django.db.models.signals```)
    - ```pre_save```, ```post_save```
    - ```pre_delete```, ```post_delete```
    - ```m2m_changed```
- For now, we'll only to make two changes 
    1. a python file ```signals.py``` under the folder **app-images/**
    2. (pre)-load the func (i.e. _signals_) in the **app-images/apps.py**

### Foreword (👋)
- We'll use a **non-relational** DB which it was called *Redis*,
- Features
    - Storing everything in memory (yet easy to make it persisted by dumping it to disk).
    - It supports diverse data structures, e.g. ```strings```, ```hashes```, ```bitmaps``` etc.
- What does that mean for us?
    - Oh! We're gonna use it for ***storing item views*** :)
- Start using it by (mixed notes: {dj-by-exp, online-tutorial})
    - get it by ```brew update && brew install redis```
    - then got the server running 
        - ```redis-server --port WHATEVER``` 
        - ```redis-cli```
- Playing with it 
    - ```redis
        SET name "alex"
        GET name 
        
        EXISTS name
    ```
    
    - ```redis
        // gone after 2 sec 
        SET name "alex"
        GET name 
        
        EXPIRE name 10
        GET name (=> nil after ten sec)
    ```
