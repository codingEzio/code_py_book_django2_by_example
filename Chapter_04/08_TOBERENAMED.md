### Foreword 
- This is how our users would use it (either one)
    - Store ur link as bookmark & user click it on a webpage 
    - then the code would be exec-ed (i.e. then it'll *scrape* the pic!)

----------

### Basic setup 
- Foreword 
    1. Most of this part (for now) is doing *js stuff* :D
- Here's what we're gonna do 
    - [x] add an entry (store the link) to the homepage 
        - Here ```app-account/templates/account/```**```dashboard.html```**
    - [x] a launcher of the core js 
        - it was stored at ```app-images/templates/```**```bookmarklet_launcher.js```**
        - go check the code to see more details 
    - [ ] the core js file 
        - [ ] the css along with it (how it was displayed (keyword:```jQuery``` ))
        - they were stored at here (under ```app-images/```**```static```**)
            - js: ```/js/bookmarklet.js``` (type it manually)
            - css: ```/css/bookmarklet.css``` (get it from [here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Django-2-by-Example/blob/master/Chapter05/bookmarks/images/static/css/bookmarklet.css) (directly copy it))
