- The todo-list (of Chapter 06) is stored at the 11st notes üòÄ
- Be sure to un-check the items when we've finished one of them :)

### Now we'll build a generic *activity stream* (ah)
- Just like the *timelines* in Twitter but more details (not just posts)
- Some preparations 
    1. ```./manage.py startapp actions```
    2. add ```'actions.apps.ActionsConfig',``` to ```INSTALLED_APPS``` (**settings.py**)
    3. add fields what we need to **app-actions/models.py**
- Lemme intro a new concept first üéâ (```contenttypes```)

### Ah! Almighty ```contenttypes```!
- A little intro 
    - Located at ```django.contrib.contenttypes```
        - also *appeared* at ```INSTALLED_APPS``` (**settings.py**)
    - It (as-an-app) tracks all models installed in your project 
        - and provides a **generic interface to interact with ur models** üòè
    - The app ```contenttypes```  contains a ```ContentType``` model 
        - Instances of it represents the actual models of your application.
- I still don't really understand it, I'll put some links here for later reading üßê 
    - [x] [How exactly do Django content types work?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20895429/how-exactly-do-django-content-types-work)
    - [ ] [How to Use Django's Generic Relations](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/10/13/how-to-use-generic-relations.html)
    - [ ] [Django ÁöÑ ContentTypes Âíå Generic Relations](http://blog.chedushi.com/archives/6048)
- It got these fields 

    | FIELD | WHAT-IT-DOES | 
    | ---: | :--- | 
    | ```app_label``` | the app's name (which the model belongs to) |
    | ```model``` | the model's name |
    | ```name``` | still the model's name (as ```verbose_name``` in class ```Meta```) |
 
### some notes about the ```contenttypes``` 
- thoughts about the answer from StackOverFlow
    - ```ForeignKey``` related 
    - Simplifying syntax yet retain the functionality (& might be better)
    - In syntax level, 
        - either add two base attrs & a generic relation (e.g. Comment) 
        - or simply adding the genericRelation to the parent one (e.g. Post)
- thoughts about examples on the book 
    - ```ContentTypes``` objects play the role of **pointing to the model used for relationship**
   
    
### Well, let's test it (though I still not fully understand it ...)
- Here is the code (from the book)
    - ```python
        from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
        from images.models import Image 
        
        image_type = ContentType.objects.get(app_label='images', model='image')
        
        // <ContentType: image>
        image_type
  
        // <class 'images.models.Image'>
        image_type.model_class()
     
        // <ContentType: image>
        ContentType.objects.get_for_model(Image)
```

### Lemme work through the steps (brief as fck)
- Add models 
    1. app-actions/models.py 
    2. migrate (last param  is actions)
    3. app-actions/admin (which is for regisering at admin))
- Add utils (which is for 'avoiding-duplicates')
    1. app-actions/utils.py (create it)
    2. okay, this it for now (a new sub-sub-chapter'll be created)
