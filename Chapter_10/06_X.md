### Foreword for our Chap. 12 !
- We'll build a **REST API** with **JSON** serialization for our project.
- Our API will provide these features
    - [ ] Retrieve *subjects*
    - [ ] Retrieve *available courses*
    - [ ] Retrieve *course contents*
    - [ ] *Enroll in* a course 
- Preparations 
    1. ```addreq djangorestframework==3.8.2```
    2. append :: ```INSTALLED_APPS```: ```'rest_framework'```
    3. new_dict :: ```REST_FRAMEWORK``` :: ```DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES``` 
        - ```[ '.. permissions.DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnnoReadOnly' ] ```

### Getting started 
- *Serializer*
    - New files under **app-courses/api/**
        -  ```__init__.py```
        - ```serializers.py```
    - Intro
        - The data *need* to be serialized for the later processing stuff.
        - Here's the classes could accomplish this <small>( diff usage though )</small>
            - ```Serializer```
            - ```ModelSerializer```
            - ```HyperlinkedModelSerializer```
        - The one we're using is the ```ModelSerializer```
            - Here's rough summary for it
                - Inherit 
                - Override props in ```class Meta``` <small>( yep, very similar huh? )</small>
        - Here's an example 
            
            ```
                from courses.models import Subject as OUR_MODEL
                from courses.api.serializers import OUR_SERIALIZER
                
                subjects   = OUR_MODEL.objects.latest('id')
                serializer = OUR_SERIALIZER(subject)
                
                # It IS native data types of Python
                # {
                #     'id': 2, 
                #     'title': 'Computer Science', 
                #     'slug': 'computer-science'
                # } 
                serializer.data
            ```
- *Renderer*
    - Intro
        - The *serialized* data has to **be rendered** 
            - in a specific format, right before you return *it* in an HTTP **response**. 

- *Parser*
    - Intro
        - The HTTP **request** you've received have to 
            - be **parsed** and **de-serialized** as the native data types.
