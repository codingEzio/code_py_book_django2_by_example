### Foreword
- We'll build a system to managing *course modules* & their contents.
    - Forms that can be used for 
        - **managing multiple modules per course**
        - **different types of content for each module**
    - Both *modules* and *contents* need to follow a **specific order**
    - We should be **able to reorder them** manually.

### New concept ```formset``` for *modules*
- One course might has many modules, well, **forms** <small>( at one page )</small>.
- Edit **app-courses/forms.py** <small>( create if not exists )</small>
    - Simply using the ```inlineformset_factory``` & passing args.
- Edit **app-courses/views.py**
    - In short
        - Overriding methods from ```TemplateResponseMixin```, ```View```
        - Specifically, those **redirect**, **GET**, **POST** kind of stuff.
- Edit **app-courses/urls.py**
    - Add route for our newly added functionality.
    - i.e. ```path('<pk>/module/', .. as_view(), name='..'),```
- Edit **app-courses/templates/courses/manage/** 
    - <u>**module/formset.html**</u>
        - This template is for *displaying multiple forms* at the same page.
    - <u>**course/list.html**</u>
        - Add an entry <small>( i.e. ```Edit modules``` )</small> to the course page.
