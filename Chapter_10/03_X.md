### Foreword
- We've built the *data model* <small>( for courses )</small>, it's time to add the **front-end**!
- These're the features we're going to implement :D 
    1. **Log in** 
    2. **List the courses** created by the instructor 
    3. Course: **create**, **edit**, **delete**
    4. Module: add it to a course & *reorder* them 
    5. Content: add different types of it to each module & *reorder* them

### The ***BASE***
- Edit **proj-educa/urls.py**
    1. Use Django's auth frmwk: ```django.contrib.auth.views``` <small>( Log in|out )</small>
    2. It'll be like: ```path('../login/', X.Y.as_view(), name='login')```
- Add resources that the *templates* need
    - The CSS
        1. ```cd PROJ/courses```
        2. ```cp -rv REPO/..10/educa/courses/```**```static/```** ``` .```
    - The JavaScript
        - You actually don't need extra work if you're using **PyCharm**.
        - But.. I don't have network access right now. 
        - Here's my solution:
            1. ```cd``` to the folder that placing the jQuery lib file
            2. Run ```python3 http.server 9000``` 
            3. Replace the url with ```http://localhost:9000/THE_FILE```
- Edit **app-courses/templates/**
    - ```base.html```
    - ```registration/```**```login.html```**
    - ```registration/```**```logged_out.html```**
