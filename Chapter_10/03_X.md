### Foreword
- We've built the *data model* <small>( for courses )</small>, it's time to add the **front-end**!
- These're the features we're going to implement :D 
    1. **Log in** 
    2. **List the courses** created by the instructor 
    3. Course: **create**, **edit**, **delete**
    4. Module: add it to a course & *reorder* them 
    5. Content: add different types of it to each module & *reorder* them

### The ***BASE***
- Edit **proj-educa/urls.py**
    1. Use Django's auth frmwk: ```django.contrib.auth.views``` <small>( Log in|out )</small>
    2. It'll be like: ```path('../login/', X.Y.as_view(), name='login')```
- Add resources that the *templates* need
    - The CSS
        1. ```cd PROJ/courses```
        2. ```cp -rv REPO/..10/educa/courses/```**```static/```** ``` .```
    - The JavaScript
        - You actually don't need extra work if you're using **PyCharm**.
        - But.. I don't have network access right now. 
        - Here's my solution:
            1. ```cd``` to the folder that placing the jQuery lib file
            2. Run ```python3 http.server 9000``` 
            3. Replace the url with ```http://localhost:9000/THE_FILE```
- Edit **app-courses/templates/**
    - ```base.html```
    - ```registration/```**```login.html```**
    - ```registration/```**```logged_out.html```**


### Creating *views*
- Specifically, we'll write **Class-based** views, with ***Mixins*** <small>( Ah )</small>.
- For me, the *mixins* are like 
    - My understanding
        - < File as module > | < Mixin as module inside a file > 
    - My understanding for quotes 
        - *.. provide multiple optional features for a class* <small>( features as ```class``` )</small>.
        - *.. use particular feature in several classes* <small>( passing in as func's arg )</small>.
- Edit **courses/views.py**
    - *CRUD* operations with **Mixins**.
    - For more just go check the code.

### Managing *permissions*
- What 
    - we wanna restrict the views (CRUD) so that **only instrcutors** have perm to *create* & *manage* courses.
    - Django has that. 
        1. We'll create a group for those instructors & assign perm stuff.
- Howto :: new group 
    - Go to [localhost:8000/admin/auth/group/add](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/auth/group/add/)
        - Name 
            - ```Instructors```
        - Perm
            - Add perms start with **courses** 
            - Except the ```courses | subject``` <small>( do not add these )</small>
- Howto :: new user
    - Go to [localhost:8000/admin/auth/user/add](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/auth/user/add/)
        - Note
            - Users that have ```is_superuser``` set to ```True``` have **all perms**. 
        - Name, Group
            - Whatever | ```Instructors```
- Howto :: views :: intro
    - We'll use the related *Mixins* of Django's <small>( being used to **restrict access** )</small>
    - Check this out
        - ```LoginRequiredMixin``` ( == ```@login_required``` ) 
        - ```PermissionRequiredMixin``` <small>( *"grant access to the view (to users have specific perm)"* )</small>
    - We simply do two things 
        1. Add a ```LoginRequiredMixin``` to our mixins <small>( ```ListView``` related )</small>.
        2. Add the ```PermissionRequiredMixin``` to our mixins to restrict access.
- Howto :: views :: code
    1. Import these two: ```LoginRequiredMixin, PermissionRequiredMixin```
    2. Inheriting ```LoginRequiredMixin``` & overriding properties
        - ```fields      = ['subject', 'title', 'slug', 'overview']```
        - ```success_url = reverse_lazy('manage_course_list')```
    2. Inheriting ```PermissionRequiredMixin``` & overriding properties
        - ```permission_required = 'courses.SPECIFIC_PERM_NAME'```

### Setting up *routes*
- **proj-educa/urls.py**
    - ```from django.urls import include```
    - ```path('course/',        include('courses.urls')),```
- **app-courses/urls.py**
    - ```from . import views```
    - ```path('mine/',        .. as_view(), name='manage_course_list'),```
    - ```path('create/',      .. as_view(), name='course_create'),```
    - ```path('<pk>/edit/',   .. as_view(), name='course_edit'),```
    - ```path('<pk>/delete/', .. as_view(), name='course_delete'),```
