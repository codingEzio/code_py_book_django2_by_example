### Enrolling like a *geek* üòè
- Let us have the basic functionality
    - Edit **app-courses/api/** :: ```views.py```
        - Get the base 
            - ```django.shortcuts.get_object_or_404```
            - ```rest_framework.views.APIView```: a bit different *view*
            - ```rest_framework.response.Response```: work with ```APIView```
        - Override ```APIView``` :: ```post```
            1. **Get** the specific **course** with a primary key 
            2. **Add** the current **user** to that course <small>( aka. **enroll** )</small>
            3. **Return** a *JSON* **```Response```** <small>( XD, too many fmts )</small>
    - Edit **app-courses/api/** :: ```urls.py```
        - ```path('courses/<pk>/enroll/', .. ,   name='course_enroll')```
    - *Theorectically*, we should be able to 
        - *enroll* a course by performing a ```POST``` request.
        - but still, we need some **API auth & permissions** to make it work.
- The *auth* & the *perm* :D 
    - Related docs: [authentication](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/), [permissions](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/).
    - Note
        - *Authentication* only **identifies the user performing the request**.
        - *Permissions* could **restrict access to views** <small>( since the *auth* couldn't do this )</small>.
    - Intro
        - The *REST framework* provides these **auth** backends
            - ```BasicAuthentication``` <small>( we're gonna use this one )</small>
            - ```TokenAUthentication``` 
            - ```SessionAuthentication```
            - ```RemoteUserAuthentication```
        - Here's some of its built-in **permissions**
            - ```AllowAny```
            - ```IsAdminUser```
            - ```IsAuthenticated```
            - ```DjangoModelPermissions```
            - ```DjangoObjectPermissions :D```
        - Memo
            - ```request.user      | AnonymousUser```
            - ```401: Unauthorized | 403: Permission denied```
    - Edit **app-courses/api/** :: ```views.py```
        - Here's the example code <small>( most details were truncated )</small>
            
            ```python
            # ...
            from rest_framework.authentication import BasicAuthentication
            from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
            
            class CourseEnrollView(APIView):
                
                authentication_classes  = (BasicAuthentication, )
                permission_classes      = (IsAuthenticated, )
                
                # ...
            ```

    - That's it! Now lemme show you how to test it 
    
        ```bash
        # Thanks to 
        #     https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#-X
        # -i            include the response headers
        # -X POST       specifies the request method
        # -u USR:PWD    specifices the username & password
        
        THE_URL = 'localhost:8000/api/courses/1/enroll/';
        
        # 401 | 200
        curl -i -X POST THE_URL
        curl -i -X POST -u USERNAME:PASSWORD THE_URL
        ```
        
### [viewsets] :: *combining* ```list``` & ```retrieve``` as one
- From my understanding so far <small>( not-that-intuitive )</small> ,
    - The ```generics.ListAPIView``` & ```.. RetrieveAPIView``` could be combined as one.
        - That is ```viewsets.XXViewSet```.
        - [?] e.g. one for listing all courses, one for listing specific one.
    - [?] The routes <small>( ```path(..)``` )</small> could be replaced by  
        - ```router = routers.DefaultRouter()```
        - ```router.register('courses', views.CourseViewSet)```
    - Ah, do distinguish that there's **two concepts here**
        1. ```rest_framework.routers```
        2. ```rest_framework.viewsets```
- Here's the steps <small>( for our cases )</small> 
    - Edit **app-courses/api/** :: ```views.py```
        - ```CourseViewSet``` :: ```viewsets.ReadOnlyModelViewSet```
            - ```queryset            = Course.objects.all()```
            - ```serializer_class    = CourseSerializer```
    - Edit **app-courses/api/** :: ```urls.py```
        - ```router = routers.DefaultRouter()```
        - ```router.register('courses', views.CourseViewSet)```
        - ```urlpatterns = [ .. , .. , path('', include(router.urls)) ]```
- Testing 
    - [localhost:8000/api/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/)
    - [localhost:8000/api/courses/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/subjects/)

### [viewsets] :: *adding* extra actions
- Edit **app-courses/api/** :: ```views.py```
    - Just go check the code.
    - It's kinda a **mixed-up** with the former knowledge :D 
- Remove these <small>( since now we got a better alternative :D )</small>
    - **views.py** :: ```CourseEnrollView```
    - **urls.py** :: ```courses/<pk>/enroll/```

### Restricting *permissions* for the contents
- Only **students enrolled in** a course should be **able to access its contents**.
- Edit **app-courses/api/** :: ```permissions.py```
    - Just go check the code.
- Edit **app-courses/api/** :: ```serializers.py```
    - Just go check the code.
