### Enrolling like a *geek* üòè
- Go to **app-courses/api/**
    - Edit ```views.py```
        - Get the base 
            - ```django.shortcuts.get_object_or_404```
            - ```rest_framework.views.APIView```: a bit different *view*
            - ```rest_framework.response.Response```: work with ```APIView```
        - Override ```APIView``` :: ```post```
            1. **Get** the specific **course** with a primary key 
            2. **Add** the current **user** to that course <small>( aka. **enroll** )</small>
            3. **Return** a *JSON* **```Response```** <small>( XD, too many fmts )</small>
    - Edit ```urls.py```
        - ```path('courses/<pk>/enroll/', .. ,   name='course_enroll')```
    - *Theorectically*, we should be able to 
        - *enroll* a course by performing a ```POST``` request.
        - but still, we need some **API auth & permissions** to make it work.
