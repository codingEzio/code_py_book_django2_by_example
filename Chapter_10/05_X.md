### Displaying *courses*
- Intro
    - List < all available | single > course<small>(s)</small>
- Edit **app-course/views.py**
    - CLASS :: ```CourseListView```
    - CLASS :: ```CourseDetailView```
- Edit **app-course/templates/courses/** 
    - **course/** <u>list.html</u>
        - course list as sidebar 
        - it contains *sort-of-categorizing*, *course-num-for-subject* <small>etc.</small> 
    - **course/** <u>detail.html</u>
        - course details like *module-num*, *instructor*, *descriptions* :D 
- Edit **app-course/urls.py**
    - ```path('subject/<slug:subject>/', .. , name='..')```
    - ```path('<slug:slug>/', .. , name='course_detail')```
    - What does these mean
        - display all **courses for a subject**
        - display a **single course** overview
- Edit **proj-educa/urls.py**
    - ```path('', CourseListView.as_view(), name='course_list')```

### Adding *registration*
- Get an *app* !
    - ```djapp students && cd students``` <small>( do remember to *update* the ```INSTALLED_APPS``` ðŸ¤ª )</small>
    - ```mkdr templates/students/student && tc registration.html && cd -```
- Edit **app-students/views.py**
    - We'll use sth like ```CreateView```, ```UserCreationForm```, ```authenticate``` <small>etc.</small> :D 
    - Boom! now we got a *decent* <small>( ha? )</small> registration page :P
    - Other requirements to make this work 
        - **proj-educa/urls.py** 
            - ```path('students/', include('students.urls')),```
        - **app-students/urls.py**
            - ```path('register/', .. as_view(), name='..registration')```
        - **app-students/ .. /registration.html**
            - Nothing fancy, most of the work had been by Django ðŸ˜˜ 

### *Enrolling* in courses
- Do remember that the **enroll** feature appears at the <u>*course details*</u> page :D 
- One more field 
    - Edit **app-courses/models.py**
        - ```.. ManyToManyField(User, .. ='courses_joined', .. )```
    - Sync to DB 
        - ```djmakemig && djmig```
    - Why, exactly
        - *Associated students with the courses in which they are enrolled*
- *Enroll* button
    - **app-courses/courses/course/detail.html**
        - Two states 
            - either ```Enroll now``` for users that have logged in
            - or ```Register to enroll``` for sort of instructions <small>( ha? )</small>
- Context data?
    - Edit **app-courses/views.py**
        - Initalizing a *form* <small>( *enroll* button, actually )</small> with ```get_context_data(..)``` 
- Edit **app-students/forms.py** <small>( create if false )</small>
    - Passing all the available courses to a ```ModelChoiceField```
    - It was set to ```forms.HiddenInput```, it's for our *apps* to use btw :D 
- Edit **app-students/views.py** 
    - Validating the *form* <small>(keyword: *enroll*, *button* )</small> & add the user to the course.
    - Then the user'll be redirected to ```student_course_detail``` <small>( hasn't impl )</small>.
- Edit **app-students/urls.py** 
    - Routes for *enrolling* : ```path('enroll-course/', .. , name='..')```
