### Here comes the Chapter 08 ðŸ¤£
- Here's the TODOs for this chapter (do remember to **uncheck after finishing one of them**)
    - [x] Integrate a payment gateway into ur project
    - [x] Export the info of the orders' as **CSV** files  
    - [x] Create custom views for the admin site 
    - [x] Generate **PDF** invoices dynamically 

-----------

### Initial steps for setting *payment gateway* up 
- Register an account at [braintreegateway](https://www.braintreegateway.com) first :D
    - Get the API keys 
        1. ```Merchant ID```
        2. ```Public Key```
        3. ```Private Key```
    - Then installing a py-lib (which'll simplify dealing with its APIs)
        - ```pip3 install braintree==3.45.0```
    - Configure stuff in ***settings.py***
        - Simply assigning keys to the variables 
        - and using *Braintree*'s ```Configuration.configure``` to conf the stuff 
        
### Now let's really **integrating it** (into our project)
- What we're **really** gonna do?
    - In brief, ***completing the check-out feature*** (=> sth REAL) we haven't finished :D
- Base 
    1. ```./manage.py startapp payment```
    2. ```payment.apps.PaymentConfig``` (append to **settings.py**)
- ***Base for other stuff***
    - run this ```rabbitmq-server``` <small>(Celery needs this)</small>
    - and this ```celery -A myshop worker -l info``` <small>(Our project need this)</small>
- A little words here 
    - The old impl for the *check-out* feature is just a page (a msg that displays '*success*' stuff)
    - The things we're doin' right now is **NOT** completely *start from scratch* :D 
        - We **ARE** modifying some of them :P
    - Okay, let's open the ***app-orders/*** **views.py**
        - OLD: ```... 'orders/order/created.html' ...```
        - NEW: ```... redirect(reverse('payment:process')) ``` <small>(after ```request.session['order_id'] = order.id```)</small>
            - Of course there's some of them has not impl_ed yet :D
            - and you need to import some modules I did not mentioned here!

### Coding started 
- Let's add the app (aka **payment**) to the proj-urls first! 
    - Edit ***proj-myshop/*** **urls.py**
        - ```path('payment/', include('payment.urls', namespace='payment')),```
    - Edit ***app-payment/*** **urls.py**
        - ```app_name = 'payment'``` (just the core part, there's more to be added)
- Okay, let's impl the simplest part (Success -> **done**, Not Success -> **canceled**)
    - Templates under **app-payment/templates/payment/** (just HTML, no code inside)
        1. ***done.html***
        2. ***canceled.html***
    - The routes (in the ***app-payment/*** **urls.py**)
        1. ```path('done/', views.payment_done, name='done')```
        2. ```path('canceled/', views.payment_canceled, name='canceled')```

### Now the core part (lemme give u an intro first, LOL)
- Foreword
    - The code (Python): **views.py**, **urls.py**
    - Another one (HTML, Javascript): ***... payment/*** **process.html** 
        - Ah! This got the similar logic to the app *image* weâ€™ve written before ðŸ˜…
- The **urls.py** is quite simple, like this:
    - ```path('process/', views.payment_process, name='processâ€™),``` 
- Let's starting with the ***views***
    - Note
        1. Most of the logic were done by **Braintree**.
        2. Things that not so intuitive were **Braintree**'s fault ðŸ™ƒ
    - ***STATUS: HALT*** (more notes will be added later)
- And the ***templates*** 
    - One for HTML (form only)
    - Another for Javascript (mostly related to ```braintree``` module)
    - ***STATUS: HALT*** (more notes will be added later)
- How to test?
    - Add some stuff to your cart then ***check-out***.
        - The credit-card info
            1. ```4111 1111 1111 1111```
            2. ```123```
            3. ```12 / 20```
        - Then submit (it might take a while, just be patient)
        - Or not, then it'll display the ***canceled.html*** we've written before ðŸ˜…
    - Other than that, check these two places
        - One for Braintree, check the tab ***TRANSACTION***
        - And our admin, check whether there's a ```Braintree id``` or not (you'll figure it our where it is)
