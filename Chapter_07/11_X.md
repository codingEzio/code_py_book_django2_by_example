### Foreword 
- We'll build a **recommendation engine** (yep, using *Redis* btw).
- Where do we start 
    - **historical** sales
    - things that usually **bought together**
- What does it look like üòè
    1. Product-Detail::Users-who-bought-this-**also**-**bought**-***XYZ***
    2. Cart-Detail::Similar-actions-like-similar-products-users-bought

### Preparation
- Oh, first make sure that you've got **at least FOUR** products.
- Get *Redis* running
    - ```pip3 install redis==2.10.6 && redis-server```
    - conf in **settings.py**
        - ```REDIS_HOST = 'localhost''```
        - ```REDIS_PORT = 6379```
        - ```REDIS_DB = 1```
- Here's how we're going to do 
    1. **Store a key for each product bought** on our site
    2. **Scoring the products**: you bought **THIS**, increase the score of **ANY OTHER PRODUCTS**.
    3. **Ranking the products**: simply two steps
        - del the products that currently in the cart 
        - sort any other products by the work of the 2nd step <small>( scores )</small>
    4. One more method for *del the recommendations in Redis* <small>( ?optional )</small>

### Testing
- Initial 
    
    ```python
    # ----- Initial 
    from shop.models import Product
    from shop.recommender import Recommender
    
    mst = Product.objects.get(translations__name='Monster Drink')
    bfv = Product.objects.get(translations__name='Battlefield V')
    dog = Product.objects.get(translations__name='Watch Dogs')
    cfe = Product.objects.get(translations__name='Coffee')
    cki = Product.objects.get(translations__name='Cookie') 
    ```
  
- The actual testing

    ```python
      
    rcmd = Recommender()  
  
    # The score should be like this
    # --------------------------
    # PRODUCT   
    # [mst]     bfv::3      dog::1     cfe::1    cki::0
    # [bfv]     mst::3      dog::1     cfe::1    cki::0
    # [dog]     mst::1      bfv::1     cfe::1    cki::2
    # [cfe]     mst::1      bfv::1     dog::1    cki::1
    # [cki]     mst::0      bfv::0     dog::2    cfe::1
    rcmd.products_bought([mst, bfv])
    rcmd.products_bought([mst, bfv, dog])
    rcmd.products_bought([mst, cfe, bfv])
    rcmd.products_bought([cki, dog])
    rcmd.products_bought([cki, dog, cfe])
    
    # Simply activating the lang 
    from django.utils.translation import activate
    activate('en')
    
    # Recommend -- one product
    rcmd.suggest_products_for([mst])
    rcmd.suggest_products_for([bfv])
    rcmd.suggest_products_for([dog])
    rcmd.suggest_products_for([cfe])
    rcmd.suggest_products_for([cki])
    
    # Recommend -- multiple products
    rcmd.suggest_products_for([mst, bfv])
    rcmd.suggest_products_for([mst, dog])
    rcmd.suggest_products_for([mst, cfe])
    rcmd.suggest_products_for([bfv, cfe])
    rcmd.suggest_products_for([cki, dog])
    ```

### Now let's actually make it available to users <small>( frontend )</small>
- Display at the product-detail page 
    - Edit **shop/views.py**
        1. Import the methods of ```recommender::Recommender```
        2. Init an instance of it 
        3. Passing the arg ```product``` in :D 
    - Edit **shop/templates/shop/product/detail.html**
        - Loop the *recommended products*
- Display at the cart page 
    - Edit **cart/views.py**
        - Import 
        - Init an inst 
        - Passing ```product``` in 
    - Edit these files under **cart/templates/detail.html**
        - Loop the *recommended products*
