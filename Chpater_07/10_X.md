### This file continues the work left by ```09_X.md```,
- that is, modifying *views* for adapting our current work (trans-related).
- Of course, it got other content as well ... (heh).

### A little about query commands (lang-related)
- Preparation 
    - ```from shop.models import Product```
    - ```from django.utils.translation import activate```
- Get by specifying langs 
    - First 
        - ```python
            # Django's way 
            activate('zh-hant')
            p_zh = Product.objects.first()
            
            # django-parler's way 
            p_en = Product.objects.language('en').first()
            
            p_zh.name                      # ‚Äòcookie‚Äô
            p_en.name                      # ‚ÄòÂ∞èÈ•ºÂπ≤‚Äô
        ```

    - Second
        - ```python
            # django-parler's way 
            p.en.set_current_language(‚Äòzh-hant‚Äô)
            
            p_en.name                      # 'Â∞èÈ•ºÂπ≤'
            p_en.get_current_language()    # 'zh-hant'
          ```
          
    - Third
        - ```python
            # search the `name` column
            Product.objects.filter(translations__name='Cookie')
          ```

### Now it's time to edit the **app-shop/views.py** 
- In short,
    1. Use ```request``` to get the current lang
    2. Add two more args for *querying* (```__language_code```, ```__slug```)
- Troubleshooting
    - ```... NoReverseMatch ...```
        - Umm.. Problem was solved after cleaning the browser cache.

### Locale formatting (e.g. ```$```, ```¬•```) 
- HOWTO :: turn it on 
    - **settings.py**: ```USE_L10N=True```
- HOWTO :: get a 3rd-party library (make life easier instead doing from scratch) 
    1. ```pip3 install django-localflavor==2.0```
    2. ```localflavor``` (append::**myshop/settings.py**)
