### Foreword
- Be sure to un-check the TODOs after finishing one of them :D (in ```05_X.md```)

----------

### Export the orders to *CSV* files 
- We’ll only need to ***customize the admin site to achieve this.
    - The one we need to modify is the **admin.py** inside the ***app-orders/*** 
    - Just go check the code for more (detailed comments inside) !
- The structure of adding the feature
    - The function (core part)
        - Passing the requirement params (this is a must)
        - Get those model
        - Set ```content-type```
        - Filtered out what u don’t need 
        - Write (using ```csv``` module or else)
    - The global scope (outmost)
        - ```YOUR_FUNC_NAME.short_description = ‘Export to CSV’```
    - The ```OrderAdmin``` (the part of registering app)
        - add attrbutes: ```actions = [ YOUR_FUNC_NAME ]```
- Test whether it works or not
    - Just go to the admin site (order part): [localhost:8000/admin/orders/order/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/orders/order/)
