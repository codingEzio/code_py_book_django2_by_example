### Foreword
- Be sure to un-check the TODOs after finishing one of them :D (in ```05_X.md```)

----------

### Export the orders to *CSV* files 
- Weâ€™ll only need to ***customize the admin site to achieve this.
    - The one we need to modify is the **admin.py** inside the ***app-orders/*** 
    - Just go check the code for more (detailed comments inside) !
- The structure of adding the feature
    - The function (core part)
        - Passing the requirement params (this is a must)
        - Get those model
        - Set ```content-type```
        - Filtered out what u donâ€™t need 
        - Write (using ```csv``` module or else)
    - The global scope (outermost)
        - ```YOUR_FUNC_NAME.short_description = â€˜Export to CSVâ€™```
    - The ```OrderAdmin``` (the part of registering app)
        - add attributes: ```actions = [ YOUR_FUNC_NAME ]```
- Test whether it works or not
    - Just go to the admin site (order part): [localhost:8000/admin/orders/order/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/orders/order/)

### Extending the admin site (with *custom views*)
- We're still (& only) *customizing* it, just more advanced 
    - The simplest (& basic) one is sth like ```list_display```, ```list_filter``` etc.
- With using *custom views*, the process will related to multiple files
    - Not like before, we're only edit/modify the existing fields for the class :D
- So, which files will be modified? 
    - Still like before (under ***app-orders/***)
        - ```admin.py```
            - ```urls.py```
                - ```views.py```
                    - ```detail.html```
    - The ***admin.py*** display the entry 
        - The ***urls.py*** is being pointed by admin
            - The ***views.py*** is the actually func being pointed by urls
                - The ***templates*** does the real work (since the views is just rendering)
- More details? 
    - Just go check the related files.
    - ***TODO: more notes needed :D***


------------ 

### Now, let's generating PDf invoices ***dynamically*** (**paid** / **unpaid**)
- There're multiple options for this purpose, yet we'll use the [*WeasyPrint*](https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html)
    - Okay, install it by 
        - ```pip3 install WeasyPrint==0.42.3```
        - ```brew install cairo pango gdk-pixbuf libffi```
    - Don't forget to add it to ```requirements.txt``` ðŸ˜…
- Still, you need to copy some files from the repo on [Github](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Django-2-by-Example)
    - Just ```git clone``` the whole repo is very recommended (by myself)
        - The files you need should be here: ```YOUR_PATH/Django-2-by-Example/Chapter08/myshop/static```
    - Now run these commands (I doubt it's necessary, maybe it's just sth new for readers to learn)
        1. Do make sure that you HAVE copied the stuff that you need :D 
        2. Append to ***settings.py***: ```STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static/')```
        3. ```./manage.py collectstatic``` (umm, you'll need to type ```yes``` to continue, normally)
- Okay, about the steps (all under ***app-orders/***)
    - Entry at ```admin.py```
        - Route at ```urls.py```
            - Core stuff at ```views.py``` 
                - Frontend templates at ```pdf.html```
- What about the details?
    - ***admin.py***
        1. The dynamic urls depend on different *shop orders*
        2. The *description* for the column name at the admin :D 
    - ***urls.py***
        1. Generating the dynamic urls 
        2. Pointing to the core function at **views.py**
    - ***views.py*** (same content as the comment inside that file)
        1. Get data (and templates for displaying data)
        2. Set type (cuz you'll need to download it, right?)
        3. Using the module (configuring stuff, e.g. the CSS :P)
    - ***templates***
        1. Nothing special, just get data & display it (with some logic, of course!)
