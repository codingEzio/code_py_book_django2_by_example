### Foreword
- Be sure to un-check the TODOs after finishing one of them :D (in ```05_X.md```)

----------

### Export the orders to *CSV* files 
- We’ll only need to ***customize the admin site to achieve this.
    - The one we need to modify is the **admin.py** inside the ***app-orders/*** 
    - Just go check the code for more (detailed comments inside) !
- The structure of adding the feature
    - The function (core part)
        - Passing the requirement params (this is a must)
        - Get those model
        - Set ```content-type```
        - Filtered out what u don’t need 
        - Write (using ```csv``` module or else)
    - The global scope (outermost)
        - ```YOUR_FUNC_NAME.short_description = ‘Export to CSV’```
    - The ```OrderAdmin``` (the part of registering app)
        - add attributes: ```actions = [ YOUR_FUNC_NAME ]```
- Test whether it works or not
    - Just go to the admin site (order part): [localhost:8000/admin/orders/order/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/orders/order/)

### Extending the admin site (with *custom views*)
- We're still (& only) *customizing* it, just more advanced 
    - The simplest (& basic) one is sth like ```list_display```, ```list_filter``` etc.
- With using *custom views*, the process will related to multiple files
    - Not like before, we're only edit/modify the existing fields for the class :D
- So, which files will be modified? 
    - Still like before (under ***app-orders/***)
        - ```admin.py```
            - ```urls.py```
                - ```views.py```
                    - ```detail.html```
    - The ***admin.py*** display the entry 
        - The ***urls.py*** is being pointed by admin
            - The ***views.py*** is the actually func being pointed by urls
                - The ***templates*** does the real work (since the views is just rendering)
- More details? 
    - Just go check the related files.
    - #TODO more notes needed :D
