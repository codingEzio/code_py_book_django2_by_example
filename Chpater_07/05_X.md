### Here comes the Chapter 08 ðŸ¤£
- Here's the TODOs for this chapter (do remember to **uncheck after finishing one of them**)
    - [ ] Integrate a payment gateway into ur project
    - [ ] Export the info of the orders' as **CSV** files  
    - [ ] Create custom views for the admin site 
    - [ ] Generate **PDF** invoices dynamically

### Initial steps for setting *payment gateway* up 
- Register an account at [braintreegateway](https://www.braintreegateway.com) first :D
    - Get the API keys 
        1. ```Merchant ID```
        2. ```Public Key```
        3. ```Private Key```
    - Then installing a py-lib (which'll simplify dealing with its APIs)
        - ```pip3 install braintree==3.45.0```
    - Configure stuff in ***settings.py***
        - Simply assigning keys to the variables 
        - and using *Braintree*'s ```Configuration.configure``` to conf the stuff 
        
### Now let's really **integrating it** (into our project)
