### Here comes the Chapter 08 ðŸ¤£
- Here's the TODOs for this chapter (do remember to **uncheck after finishing one of them**)
    - [ ] Integrate a payment gateway into ur project
    - [ ] Export the info of the orders' as **CSV** files  
    - [ ] Create custom views for the admin site 
    - [ ] Generate **PDF** invoices dynamically 

-----------

### Initial steps for setting *payment gateway* up 
- Register an account at [braintreegateway](https://www.braintreegateway.com) first :D
    - Get the API keys 
        1. ```Merchant ID```
        2. ```Public Key```
        3. ```Private Key```
    - Then installing a py-lib (which'll simplify dealing with its APIs)
        - ```pip3 install braintree==3.45.0```
    - Configure stuff in ***settings.py***
        - Simply assigning keys to the variables 
        - and using *Braintree*'s ```Configuration.configure``` to conf the stuff 
        
### Now let's really **integrating it** (into our project)
- What we're **really** gonna do?
    - In brief, ***completing the check-out feature*** (=> sth REAL) we haven't finished :D
- Base 
    1. ```./manage.py startapp payment```
    2. ```payment.apps.PaymentConfig``` (append to **settings.py**)
- ***Base for other stuff***
    - run this ```rabbitmq-server``` <small>(Celery needs this)</small>
    - and this ```celery -A myshop worker -l info``` <small>(Our project need this)</small>
- A little words here 
    - The old impl for the *check-out* feature is just a page (a msg that displays '*success*' stuff)
    - The things we're doin' right now is **NOT** completely *start from stratch* :D 
        - We **ARE** modifying some of them :P
    - Okay, let's open the ***app-orders/*** **views.py**
        - OLD: ```... 'orders/order/created.html' ...```
        - NEW: 
            - code 
                - ```request.session['order_id'] = order.id```
                - ```redirect(reverse('payment:process'))``` 
            - Of course there's some of them has not impl_ed yet :D
            - and you need to import some modules I did not mentioned here!
- Let's add the app (aka **payment**) to the proj-urls first! 
    - Edit ***proj-myshop/*** **urls.py**
        - ```path('payment/', include('payment.urls', namespace='payment')),```
    - Edit ***app-payment/*** **urls.py**
        - ```app_name = 'payment'``` (just the core part, there's more to be added)
