### Foreword
- New models needed, and using the *session* framework (of Django)
- I've omitted the *intro for session framework* (digging more later)

### Concept
- Options for storing session data 
    - Database
    - File-system
    - **Cached-based sessions**
    - Cached-based database sessions
    - Cookie-based sessions
- And you could customize it, e.g. (in **settings.py**) 
    - *```SESSION_COOKIE_AGE```*
    - *```SESSION_SAVE_EVERY_REQUEST```*
    - *```SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE```* etc.

----------
  
### A little word
- What do we need to store 
    1. The **ID** of a ```Product``` instance
    2. The **quantity** for the product
    3. The **unit price** for the product (we **need** to cuz it might vary!)
- The mechanics for this 
    1. Check whether a custom session key [ is set => good ] OR [ not => create one]
    2. For the *successive requests*, 
        - we're doing the same thing,
        - that is **trying to get the cart items** from the session key (also includes **DB**)

### Impl the ***cart***
- Firstly 
    1. Create a new app 
        - ```django-admin startapp cart```
        - then add ```'cart.apps.CartConfig'``` to **proj/settings.py**
    2. Add a constant 
        - Append ```CART_SESSION_ID = 'cart'``` to **proj/settings.py**
        - It actually will be ***used as a session key*** (as a dict in the side of code)
- Second 
    - Implementing the necessary methods for the ***cart*** app
        - Touch a new file in here: **app-cart**/***```cart.py```***
    - I'll only show a list of the methods that is needed 
        - Init 
            - ```__init__()```
        - Session
            - ```save```, ```clear``` 
        - Cart opt
            - ```add```, ```remove```
        - Cart info
            - ```__iter__()```, ```__len__()```, ```get_total_price```
