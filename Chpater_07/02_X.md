### Foreword
- New models needed, and using the *session* framework (of Django)
- I've omitted the *intro for session framework* (digging more later)

### Concept
- Options for storing session data 
    - Database
    - File-system
    - **Cached-based sessions**
    - Cached-based database sessions
    - Cookie-based sessions
- And you could customize it, e.g. (in **settings.py**) 
    - *```SESSION_COOKIE_AGE```*
    - *```SESSION_SAVE_EVERY_REQUEST```*
    - *```SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE```* etc.

----------
  
### A little word
- What do we need to store 
    1. The **ID** of a ```Product``` instance
    2. The **quantity** for the product
    3. The **unit price** for the product (we **need** to cuz it might vary!)
- The mechanics for this 
    1. Check whether a custom session key [ is set => good ] OR [ not => create one]
    2. For the *successive requests*, 
        - we're doing the same thing,
        - that is **trying to get the cart items** from the session key (also includes **DB**)

### Impl the ***cart*** 
- Firstly 
    1. Create a new app 
        - ```django-admin startapp cart```
        - then add ```'cart.apps.CartConfig'``` to **proj/settings.py**
    2. Add a constant 
        - Append ```CART_SESSION_ID = 'cart'``` to **proj/settings.py**
        - It actually will be ***used as a session key*** (as a dict in the side of code)
- Second (kinda like a ***helper***)
    - Implementing the necessary methods for the ***cart*** app
        - Touch a new file in here: **app-cart**/***```cart.py```***
    - I'll only show a list of the methods that is needed 
        - Init 
            - ```__init__()```
        - Session
            - ```save```, ```clear``` 
        - Cart opt
            - ```add```, ```remove```
        - Cart info
            - ```__iter__()```, ```__len__()```, ```get_total_price```
            
### Impl the ***views*** of the **cart**
- Here’s what we’re gonna do 
    - A view to ***add or update items in a cart***
    - A view to ***remove items from the cart***
    - A view to ***display cart items and totals***
- Get a form <small>(**forms.py**)</small> ! (under **app-cart/**)
    - One for *quantity* (how many you wanna buy)
    - Another for *update* (add or update)
- The **app-cart/views.py** 
    - Most of the functionality has been impl_ed in the **app-cart/cart.py**
    - The *view* does these things 
        1. get, clean, post data
        2. redirecting 
        3. rendering 
    - And the related templates (under **app-cart/templates/**)
        - here: ***cart***/**detail.html**
        - go check the code for more details 
- Add an entry to the product page (detail page instead of the list)
    - **app-shop/templates/shop/product/detail.html**
        - a new form ('add-to-cart')
    - **app-shop/views.py**
        - init a form & rendering it 
- Finally, setup the routes 
    - **app-cart/urls.py**
        - simply *add*, *remove*, *cart-detail* :D
    - **proj-myshop/urls.py**
        - the app 'cart'
