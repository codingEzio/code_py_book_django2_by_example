### Now we'll use the *Rosetta* translation interface 
- Intro for the module
    - It's a third-party app that allows u to<br>edit translations.
- Preparation
    - Get it 
        - ```pip3 install django-rosetta==0.8.1```
    - Get it running 
        - ```rosetta``` (append::**myshop/settings.py**)
        - ```path('rosetta/', include('rosetta.urls'))``` (append::**myshop/urls.py**)
    - Go check it here
        - [*localhost:8000/rosetta*](http://localhost:8000/rosetta)
- Some notes here 
    - For translation editing
        - You could basically do anything 
            - So .. the **translation** has ***ALREADY been done at the web interface***!
        - The ```makemessages --all```, ```compilemessages``` will be exec_ed automatically.
    - For translation collaboration
        - Steps: New group ```translators``` => new users add into that group :D 
    - What is ***FUZZY*** (one of the column on the ```rosetta``` page) ? 
        - It's a feature which provided by ```gettext``` (not *Rosetta*!)
        - It **marks translation strings that need to be reviewed***.
            - In plain words, the ```gettext``` would kinda verify the result.
            - If your work doesnt reach that *level*, it will NOT compile (yep).
