### Now we're going to add ***Internationalization*** to our project :D 
- Some concepts ahead
    1. *Django* got its own *i18n framework* 
        - It allows you to **mark strings for trans** (*both in code & templates*).
    2. A **message file** is a plain text file that represents *a language*, 
        - that it contains *a part, or all*, of the {**trans-str**, **trans**} in ur app :D 
        - The extension for it is ```.po``` (ah).
        - The **compiled** translation files is ```.mo``` (hmm).
    3. *Django* got some settings for it (aka **settings.py**)
        - e.g. 
        - ```LOCALE_PATHS```
        - ```USE_TZ```, ```TIME_ZONE```
        - ```USE_I18N```, ```USE_L10N```
        - ```LANGUAGE```, ```LANGUAGE_CODE```
    4. Okay, now you need this: ```gettext``` 
        - ```brew update && brew install gettext``` (Windows users check [this](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/i18n/translation/#gettext-on-windows))
        - append to ```.*rc```: ```PATH="/usr/local/opt/gettext/bin:$PATH"``` 
- The process to i18nize 
    1. Mark strings for translation (code & templates)
    2. Run ```makemessages``` to update|create the msg files
    3. Add those translations and then compile them by ```compilemessages```
- How does Django know? (& the orders)
    - I'd recommend that just go check the [doc](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/i18n/translation/#how-django-discovers-language-preference) (very, very nice)
- Software for this stuff
    - [Poedit](https://www.poedit.net/) <small>(not free, but open-source)</small>
- Edit **settings.py** 
    - Foreword
        - Details are takin' as code in that file :D
        - So, check that file out ðŸ˜…
    - What to change
        - ```MIDDLEWARE```
            - ```django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware```
        - ```LOCALE_PATHS```
            - ```( os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'locale/')  )```
        - ```LANGUAGE```
            - sth like ```( ('en', 'English'), ... )```
        - ```LANGUAGE_CODE``` 
            - sth like ```en```
    - For the ```LOCALE_PATHS``` you named 
        - the new gen_ed files will stored inside the ```locale/``` (root-level)
        - but, if ur app also have the folder, the gen_ed file will be stored in **there**.
- Add new stuff
    - New folders under your ROOT folder (same level as ```manage.py```)
    - Also known as ***/locale/*** (an example down below)
        - **en/**
        - **zh_Hant/**

### Cut the shit, let's **really** start!
- (Still) edit the **settings.py**
    - import: 
        - ```from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _```
    - modify (variable ```LANGUAGE```)
        - ```('en', _('English')),```
        - ```('zh-hant', _('Traditional Chinese')),```
    - And other stuff
        - "make" it 
            - ```django-admin makemessages --all``` (make sure you got ```gettext``` & the env was set)
        - "compile" it 
            - ```django-admin compilemessages``` (now you should got ```.mo``` files)
- Edit ***app-orders/*** **models.py**
    - Let's trans the basic stuff first,
        1. ```from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _```
        2. modify them like this ```xx.XXField(_('THE MARKER'), ORIGINAL_STUFF)```
    - New folders under the app 'orders'
        1. ```mkdir -p locale/en locale/zh_Hant```
        2. ```django-admin makemessages --all``` (now we've got separated trans files (proj | app))
- Okay, two other *forms* (same ```import``` as prev_ly used, for both)
    - ***app-cart/*** **forms.py**
        - append arg: ```label=_('Quantity')```
    - ***app-coupons/*** **forms.py**
        - append arg: ```label=_('Coupon')``` 
        
### Now, it's time to add markers for the **templates** ðŸ˜†
- Foreword
    - use it ```{% load i18n %}```
    - mark a little piece 
        - ```{% trans "Hello" %}```
        - ```{% trans "Hello" as greeting %}``` 
    - mark a block 
        - ```{% blocktrans %} ... {% endblocktrans %}```
        - ```{% blocktrans with name=XXX %} ... {{ name }} ... {% endblocktrans %}```
- Note 
    - about ```{% blocktrans %}```
        - You cannot use stuff like ```{% if %}``` inside (almost none (there's reason for it!))
        - Variable you need should be ***prepared before the block***, ***a little process at starting of the block***.
    - about when to use ```{% blocktrans %}```
        - Use it when u need **included variable content** in your translation string.
        - e.g. ```{{ Hello THE_VAR_FOR_NAME }}``` (placeholder!)
