### Now we're going to add ***Internationalization*** to our project :D 
- Some concepts ahead
    1. *Django* got its own *i18n framework* 
        - It allows you to **mark strings for trans** (*both in code & templates*).
    2. A **message file** is a plain text file that represents *a language*, 
        - that it contains *a part, or all*, of the {**trans-str**, **trans**} in ur app :D 
        - The extension for it is ```.po``` (ah).
        - The **compiled** translation files is ```.mo``` (hmm).
    3. *Django* got some settings for it (aka **settings.py**)
        - e.g. 
        - ```LOCALE_PATHS```
        - ```USE_TZ```, ```TIME_ZONE```
        - ```USE_I18N```, ```USE_L10N```
        - ```LANGUAGE```, ```LANGUAGE_CODE```
    4. Okay, now you need this: ```gettext``` 
        - ```brew update && brew install gettext``` (Windows users check [this](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/i18n/translation/#gettext-on-windows))
- The process to i18nize 
    1. Mark strings for translation (code & templates)
    2. Run ```makemessages``` to update|create the msg files
    3. Add those translations and then compile them by ```compilemessages```
- How does Django know? (& the orders)
    - I'd recommend that just go check the [doc](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/i18n/translation/#how-django-discovers-language-preference) (very, very nice)
- Edit **settings.py** 
    - Foreword
        - Details are takin' as code in that file :D
        - So, check that file out ðŸ˜…
    - What to change
        - ```MIDDLEWARE```
            - ```django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware```
        - ```LOCALE_PATHS```
            - ```( os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'locale/')  )```
        - ```LANGUAGE```
            - sth like ```( ('en', 'English'), ... )```
        - ```LANGUAGE_CODE``` 
            - sth like ```en```
    - For the ```LOCALE_PATHS``` you named 
        - the new gen_ed files will stored inside the ```locale/``` (root-level)
        - but, if ur app also have the folder, the gen_ed file will be stored in **there**.
- Add new stuff
    - New folders under your ROOT folder (same level as ```manage.py```)
    - Also known as ***/locale/*** (an example down below)
        - **en/**
        - **zh_Hant/**
