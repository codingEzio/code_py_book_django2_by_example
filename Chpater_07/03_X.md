### Foreword 
- New concept 
- New improvements 

### memo
- why context processor 
    - being here to solve 'the msg <ur cart is empty> always appears'
    - it also should display the right stuff in the right situation 
        - when the cart is 
            - null      ->  empty
            - not null  ->  the amount which u put into the cart 
- intro for context processor 
    - it's a func that takes the ```request``` obj as a param
        - and then returns a dict that gets added to the request context 
        - they come in handy when you *need to* ***make sth available globally to all templates***!
    - well, it IS handy in **some** cases
        - but the ```custom template tag``` still got its own place!
- what we're gonna accomplish 
    - create a context processor **to set the current cart into the request context**
    - & then we'll be able to ***access the cart in any template***
    
### Getting started 
- Make a new file: **context_processors.py** (under **app-cart/**)
    - we're simply creating a inst, like this 
    - ```python
        from .cart import Cart
        
        def cart(request):
            return {'cart': Cart(request)}
    ```

- Now, we need to let Django ‚Äò*knows*‚Äô it!
    - where: **proj-myshop/settings.py** 
        - -> ```TEMPLATES``` -> ```OPTIONS``` -> ```context_processors```
    - append: ```'cart.context_processors.cart'```
        - APP_FOLDER_NAME _ PROCESSOR_FILE_NAME _ FUNC_NAME
- Alright, the *last* step is to add some logic to the templates 
    - where: **app-shop/templates/shop/base.html**
    - how: simply get the values passed from the inst (*cart*)
        - either ***you got X items, total $xx***
        - or ***your cart is empty***

----------

### Getting started for the ***checkout*** feature!
- The very first step, well .. üòÇ you know 
    1. ```django-admin startapp``` **```orders```**
    2. append **```orders.apps.OrdersConfig```** to ```INSTALLLED_APPS```
- New models (here: **app-orders/models.py**)
    - Create
        - One for detailed order info: ```Order```
        - The other for the item only: ```OrderItem```
    - Migrate
        - ```./manage.py makemigrations```
        - ```./manage.py migrate```
    - Register at **app-orders/admin.py**

### Details steps for impl_ing it :P
- Foreword 
    - A new (real) order'll be created following these steps 
        1. present an ***order form*** to fill in their data
        2. create an inst of ```Order``` ***with the data entered***,
            - and create an associated ```OrderItem``` for each item in the cart 
        3. clear all the cart content & ***redirect users to a success page*** :D
- Alright, let's start!
    - Create a file named **forms.py** under ***app/orders/***
    - Then write **views.py** (still under the ***app/orders/***)
        - We'll write some *logic* & *x* here :D
        - Old ways still, only with some cases-specific stuff :D
    - Then (2x XD) **set up the routes** (create a **urls.py** first!)
        - One for app-level
            - sth like: ```path('create/', views.order_create, name='order_create')```
        - Another for proj-level
            - like this: ```path('orders/', include('orders.urls', namespace='orders'))```
- Now the templates (the logic is mostly done)
    - Under ***app-orders/templates/orders/order/*** (create if it does not exist)
        - **create.html** for the *checkout* page :D
        - and the **created.html** is for *displaying the ‚Äúcheckout succefully‚Äù page*
- Finally, add **an entry on the cart page** :D
    - Here: ***app-cart/templates/cart/*** **detail.html**
