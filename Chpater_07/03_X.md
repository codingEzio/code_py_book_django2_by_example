- New concept 
- New improvements 

### memo
- why context processor 
    - being here to solve 'the msg <ur cart is empty> always appears'
    - it also should display the right stuff in the right situation 
        - when the cart is 
            - null      ->  empty
            - not null  ->  the amount which u put into the cart 
- intro for context processor 
    - it's a func that takes the ```request``` obj as a param
        - and then returns a dict that gets added to the request context 
        - they come in handy when you *need to* ***make sth available globally to all templates***!
    - well, it IS handy in **some** cases
        - but the ```custom template tag``` still got its own place!
- what we're gonna accomplish 
    - create a context processor **to set the current cart into the request context**
    - & then we'll be able to ***access the cart in any template***
    
### Getting started 
- Make a new file: **context_processors.py** (under **app-cart/**)
    - we're simply creating a inst, like this 
    - ```python
        from .cart import Cart
        
        def cart(request):
            return {'cart': Cart(request)}
    ```

- Now, we need to let Django ‘*knows*’ it!
    - where: **proj-myshop/settings.py** 
        - -> ```TEMPLATES``` -> ```OPTIONS``` -> ```context_processors```
    - append: ```'cart.context_processors.cart'```
        - APP_FOLDER_NAME _ PROCESSOR_FILE_NAME _ FUNC_NAME
- Alright, the *last* step is to add some logic to the templates 
    - where: **app-shop/templates/shop/base.html**
    - how: simply get the values passed from the inst (*cart*)
        - either ***you got X items, total $xx***
        - or ***your cart is empty***
