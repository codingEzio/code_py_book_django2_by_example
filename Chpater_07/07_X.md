### Here comes the Chapter 09 😁
- Here's what we're gonna do in this chapter (rough start)
    - [x] Adding a coupon system to apply *discounts*
    - Adding i18n to our project 
        - [x] *Rosetta* for managing translations 
        - [ ] *django-parler* for translating models  
    - [ ] Building a product recommendation engine
    
### Writing the basic stuff for the app *coupons* 
- The very start 
    - ```django-admin startapp coupons```
    - ```'coupons.apps.CouponsConfig'``` (append to **settings.py**)
- Writing models 
    - Here's the list, at least for now :D 
        1. ```code``` (the one give u discounts!)
        2. ```valid_from``` Dec.01 ```valid_to``` Dec.30)
        3. ```discount```: how much (0% ~ 100%)
        4.```active```: whether you could use it 
    - Sync to DB 
        - ```./manage.py makemigrations && ./manage.py migrate```
    - Register it at admin page 
        - Inherit ```admin.ModelAdmin``` & import our models 
            - override these fields 
                - ```list_display```, ```list_display```, ```search_fields```
            - then register it 
                - ```admin.site.register(MODEL_NAME, THE_CLASS_INHERIT_ADMIN)```
- The logic 
    - Adding stuff to cart, and with a ***coupon*** code
        - Submit for us to check 
            - ```active``` -> ```valid_from_to```
            - all good? save it for later display (for us)
        - Display the prices after discounted 
            - that happens after users placed an order 

### App *coupons* :: forms, views, routes
- Get a HTML widget (**forms.py**)
    - Like ```code = forms.CharField()```
- Write **views.py**
    - First 
        - import the *forms*
        - init two things we need: ```now()```, the form (with ```POST```)
    - Second 
        - filter the coupon (must match, valid & active)
        - add the ```id``` to ```request.session``` <small>(```None``` if not exists)</small>
    - Third 
        - Redirect users to the *cart detail* page (not checking-out yet)
- Add routes (**urls.py**) for it 
    - app level 
        - add ```app_name = 'coupons'``` first 
        - and ```path('apply/', views.coupon_apply, name='apply')```
    - proj level 
        - add ```path('coupons/', include('coupons.urls', namespace='coupons'))```

### Apply a *coupon* :: to **Cart**
- Edit the ***app-carts/*** **cart.py** (**THIS IS THE BASE**)
    - ```class-Cart/__init__```
        - ```self.coupon_id = self.session.get('coupon_id')```
    - ```class-Cart/``` **prop & methods**
        - ```Coupon.objects.get(id=self.coupon_id)```
        - ```get_discount```
        - ```get_total_price_after_discount```
- Edit the ***app-carts/*** things related to ```cart_detail```
    - **views.py** 
        - Simply add the HTML widget to the **cart's detail page** (```CouponApplyForm()```)
    - **cart/detail.html**
        - Foreword 
            - One => Three (blocks)
        - Structure 
            1. if got *coupon*
                - original price 
                - code & discount (e.g. "8888" & "20% off")
                - the discount (e.g. -6)
            2. display the price **after discount** 
                - it's okay even there's None (equivalent to "0% off" (-0))
            3. type *coupon* code & submit (the first two are inside the same table) 
                

### Apply a *coupon* :: to **Order Detail**
- Edit the ***app-orders/templates/orders/order/*** **create.html**
    - Foreword
        - OLD: Loop the cart 
        - NEW: Loop (*cart, *coupon) => the price after discounted 

### Okay, now users could *apply* it (at ***cart***, ***order-detail***)
- But still, users cannot actually *use* it (the price is actually still the original price!!)
    - Now we need to store that coupon info :D 
- Edit ***app-orders/*** **models.py**
    - Two new fields: ```Coupon``` (as fk), ```discount``` :D 
    - One methods need to be modified a little bit
        - OLD: calc total cost by loop 
        - NEW: still calc total by loop, & subtract the discount (0 is acceptable, heh)
    - Sync to DB 
        1. ```./manage.py makemigrations```
        2. ```./manage.py migrate``` **```orders```**
- Edit ***app-orders/*** **views.py**
    - Got coupon? Save it to DB (that is, **TRULY** apply to the order)
        - First change the ```.save()``` to ```.save(commit=False)```
        - ```if cart.coupon:```
            - ```order.coupon = cart.coupon```
            - ```order.discount = cart.coupon.discount```
            - ```order.save()```
    - Alright, done 😃!
