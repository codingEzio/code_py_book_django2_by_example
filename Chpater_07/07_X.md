### Here comes the Chapter 09 üòÅ
- Here's what we're gonna do in this chapter (rough start)
    1. Adding a coupon system to apply *discounts*
    2. Adding i18n to our project 
        - *Rosetta* for managing translations 
        - *django-parler* for translating models  
    3. Building a product recommendation engine
    
### Getting started from the *Coupon* system 
- The very start 
    - ```django-admin startapp coupons```
    - ```'coupons.apps.CouponsConfig'``` (append to **settings.py**)
- Writing models 
    - Here's the list, at least for now :D 
        1. ```code``` (the one give u discounts!)
        2. ```valid_from``` Dec.01 ```valid_to``` Dec.30)
        3. ```discount```: how much (0% ~ 100%)
        4.```active```: whether you could use it 
    - Sync to DB 
        - ```./manage.py makemigrations && ./manage.py migrate```
    - Register it at admin page 
        - Inherit ```admin.ModelAdmin``` & import our models 
            - override these fields 
                - ```list_display```, ```list_display```, ```search_fields```
            - then register it 
                - ```admin.site.register(MODEL_NAME, THE_CLASS_INHERIT_ADMIN)```
