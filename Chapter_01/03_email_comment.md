### Foreword 
- The era of **Chapter 2 BEGINS**!
- The first thing is **allow users to share posts** by *sending them emails* :P
- And after that, weâ€™ll create a **comment system**.

----- 

### Sharing post by sending an email ðŸ˜Ž
- Creating the ***forms*** (static thing)
    - app-folder/```forms.py```
        - inherit ```django.forms.Form```
        - create field (whichâ€™ll be conv to widgets of HTML)
- Importing it into ```views.py``` (real functionality)
    - firstly  
        - import form ```from .forms import EmailPostForm```
        - import get-post ```from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404```
    - a new func ```post_share```
        - what does it do?
            - It mostly appears at each post (*detail page*)
            - So, itâ€™s just a link (in usersâ€™ perspective)
        - what does it contain?
            - get object (current post)
            - send email or not 
                - via ```GET``` => display blank form (to be typed in)
                - via ```POST``` => post it 
                    - valid => ***send it then rendering the page***
                    - no? => Django (& browser) would stop
            - the email info 
                - content youâ€™re gonna send (*subject*, *msg* etc. )
    - And the templates 
        - each post got a share link! (aka blog/post/```detail.html```)
        - share page itself (aka blog/post/```share.html```)
            - sent successfully 
            - OR display the sent-email page 
    - The blog/```urls.py```
        - A new (& valid) page for sending emails (ya need a page to display the forms! did you forget?)
    - The my_site/```settings.py```
        - configure the backend (whether itâ€™s a real one or not)

### And letâ€™s create the bloody ðŸ˜™ comment system!
