### Foreword 
- The era of **Chapter 3 BEGINS**!
- We'll **customize** our own **template tags** to ***perform custom actions*** :P 

----- 

### Setup 
- File
    - Structure 
        - blog/```templatetags/```
        - blog/**templatetags**/```__init__.py```
        - blog/**templatetags**/```blog_tags.py```
    - Note 
        1. the filename determines how you ref them in template (e.g. ```{% load blog_tags %}```)
        2. the tag name could be customized 
            - ```@register.simple_tag()                =>  it would use the func being decoed```
            - ```@register.simple_tag(name=TAG_NAME)   =>  it would use the TAG_NAME```
- Methods 
    1. ```simple_tag```: process the data and returns a string 
    2. ```inclusion_tag```: process the data and returns a **rendered** template
- Okay, let's edit the ```base.html``` (dead simple), 
    1. "import" by ```{% load blog_tags %}``` (put this before ```<!DOCTYPE html>```)
    2. use it by ```I've written {% my_post_count %} posts for now ðŸ˜Œ.```
    
### Alright, let's add another feature: ***displaying latest posts in the sidebar*** 
- Still editing the blog/**templatetags**/```blog_tags.py```
    - A new function ```show_latest_posts()``` which is *decorated* by ```@register.inclusion_tag(...)```
- And the related two templates 
    - One for our purpose ```base.html``` (that make it displayed on the homepage)
    - And the func which is tightly connected with: **templates/blog/post/** ```latest_posts.html```

# And of course, ***most commended posts*** ðŸ™‚
- Still editing the blog/**templatetags**/```blog_tags.py```
    - A new function ```get_most_commented_posts()``` which is *decorated* by ```@register.simple_tag```
- And go on editing the ```base.html```
    - It's simply using the vals of variables that comes from the function we've written before :P
